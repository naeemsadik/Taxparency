# Taxparency - Blockchain-Based Fintech Project

## üèõÔ∏è Overview
Taxparency is a revolutionary blockchain-based transparency platform designed specifically for Bangladesh's taxation and public procurement systems. Unlike traditional cryptocurrency projects, Taxparency uses blockchain technology as a transparent, immutable database to ensure accountability in government financial processes.

### ‚ú® Key Innovation
- **No Cryptocurrencies**: Uses blockchain purely for transparency and data integrity
- **Dual Blockchain Architecture**: Private blockchain for tax returns, public blockchain for procurement voting
- **IPFS Integration**: Decentralized storage for PDF documents
- **Democratic Participation**: Citizens can vote on public procurement decisions

## Project Structure

## Key Features

### User Types and Dashboards
1. **Citizens**: Login with TIIN, upload tax returns, view procurement voting
2. **NBR Officers**: Audit and approve/decline tax returns
3. **Vendors**: Submit bids for public procurements
4. **BPPA Officers**: Manage procurements and approve vendors

### Blockchain Implementation
1. **Private Blockchain**: Store tax returns (IPFS CID, TIIN, costs, income) with NBR validation
2. **Public Blockchain**: Store shortlisted procurement bids for public voting

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: PHP/Laravel
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web3.js
- **Blockchain**: Solidity smart contracts
- **Database**: SQLite for user credentials
- **File Storage**: IPFS for PDF documents

## Setup Instructions

### Backend (Laravel)
```bash
cd backend
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve
```

### Blockchain Development
- Install Hardhat or Truffle for smart contract development
- Set up local blockchain network (Ganache)
- Deploy contracts to private and public networks

### Frontend
- Open frontend/index.html in browser
- Ensure Web3.js integration with blockchain networks
- Connect to Laravel backend APIs

## Development Workflow
1. Set up local development environment
2. Deploy smart contracts to local blockchain
3. Configure Laravel backend with blockchain integration
4. Develop frontend interfaces
5. Test complete workflow with all user types

## Security Considerations
- User credentials stored in encrypted SQLite database
- Tax return PDFs stored on IPFS with blockchain references
- Smart contracts audited for vulnerabilities
- Role-based access control implemented
