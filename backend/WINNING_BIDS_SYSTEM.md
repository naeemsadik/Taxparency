- **Blockchain integration** with automatic off-chain fallback
- **Data integrity verification** with SHA256 hashes
- **Comprehensive vendor performance tracking**
- **Public transparency through API endpoints**
- **Real-time contract progress monitoring**

## 🔗 **Blockchain Integration**

### **Dual Storage Strategy:**
1. **On-Chain Storage** (when blockchain is available)
   - Real blockchain transactions with gas tracking
   - Smart contract deployment for each winning bid
   - Immutable record with block confirmations

2. **Off-Chain Storage** (fallback when blockchain unavailable)
   - SHA256 integrity hashes for data verification
   - JSON backup in `blockchain_backup` table
   - Automatic sync attempts when blockchain becomes available

### **Blockchain Service Features:**
- **Automatic failover** between on-chain and off-chain storage
- **Data integrity verification** for off-chain records
- **Bulk sync operations** for pending records
- **Error tracking and retry mechanisms**

---

## 🏗️ **Model Architecture**

### **WinningBid Model (`app/Models/WinningBid.php`)**

**Relationships:**
- `procurement()` → Procurement details
- `bid()` → Original winning bid
- `vendor()` → Winner company information
- `awardedByOfficer()` → BPPA officer who awarded

**Helper Methods:**
- `getContractDurationDays()` → Total contract days
- `getContractProgress()` → Current completion percentage
- `isContractActive()` → Whether contract is currently active
- `getTimeUntilCompletion()` → Human-readable time remaining
- `generateOffchainHash()` → SHA256 integrity verification
- `syncToBlockchain()` → Manual blockchain sync

**Scopes:**
- `awarded()`, `inProgress()`, `completed()` → Filter by status
- `onChain()`, `offChain()` → Filter by storage type
- `pendingBlockchainSync()` → Find unsynchronized records

---

## 🌐 **API Endpoints**

### **Public Transparency Endpoints:**
```http
GET /api/v1/public/winning-bids              # List all winning bids (paginated)
GET /api/v1/public/winning-bids/{id}         # Specific winning bid details
GET /api/v1/public/winning-bids/statistics   # System-wide statistics
GET /api/v1/public/winning-bids/vendor/{id}  # Vendor-specific winning history
```

### **BPPA Management Endpoints:**
