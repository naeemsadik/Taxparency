# Citizen Voting Functionality Testing Guide

## ✅ Status: FULLY FIXED AND TESTED

The citizen voting functionality has been implemented, all issues resolved, and test data created. The network error has been fixed by correcting the API endpoint URL and authentication fields. Here's how to test it:

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Set Up Test Data
Test data has been created with the seeder:
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=VotingTestSeeder
```

### 2. Start the Server
```bash
php artisan serve
```

### 3. Test Voting Process

#### Step 1: Login as Citizen
- Go to: `http://localhost:8000/login/citizen`
- Enter any TIIN (e.g., `citizen123`)
- Enter any password (e.g., `password123`)

#### Step 2: Access Citizen Dashboard
- After login, you'll be redirected to the citizen dashboard
- You should see the "Public Procurement Voting" section

#### Step 3: Vote on Procurement Bids
You should see:
- **Procurement**: "Test Road Construction Project"
- **3 Shortlisted Bids** from different vendors
- Vote buttons (👍 Vote YES / 👎 Vote NO) for each bid

#### Step 4: Cast Your Vote
- Click on either "👍 Vote YES" or "👎 Vote NO" for any bid
- Confirm your vote when prompted
- You should see a success message with blockchain transaction details
- The page will refresh and show your vote status

## 🔑 Test Credentials

### Citizens
- **TIIN**: Any value (e.g., `citizen123`, `test456`, etc.)
- **Password**: Any value
- *Note: Citizens are auto-created for demo purposes*

### Other Users (for full system testing)
- **BPPA Officer**: `bppa.officer1` / `bppa123`
- **Vendors**: `abc.construction` / `vendor123`
- **NBR Officer**: `nbr.officer1` / `nbr123`

## 🚨 Expected Voting Behavior

### ✅ Valid Voting Scenarios:
1. Citizen can vote YES or NO on any shortlisted bid
2. Citizen can only vote ONCE per bid
3. Vote counts are updated immediately
4. Blockchain transaction hash is generated
5. Voting history is recorded

### ❌ Invalid Voting Scenarios:
1. Voting twice on the same bid → Error: "You have already voted for this bid"
2. Voting on non-shortlisted bids → Error: "Bid is not available for public voting"
3. Voting after deadline → Error: "Voting period has ended"
4. Voting without authentication → Error: "Not authenticated"

## 🔍 Verification Steps

### Frontend Verification:
1. **Dashboard shows active procurements** ✅
2. **Shortlisted bids are displayed** ✅
3. **Vote buttons are functional** ✅
4. **Vote confirmation works** ✅
5. **Success messages appear** ✅
6. **Vote status is updated** ✅
7. **Already voted bids show status** ✅

### Backend Verification:
1. **Vote records are created in database** ✅
2. **Bid vote counts are incremented** ✅
3. **Duplicate votes are prevented** ✅
4. **API responses are correct** ✅
5. **Session authentication works** ✅

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No active procurement voting available"
- **Solution**: Run the seeder: `php artisan db:seed --class=VotingTestSeeder`

### Issue: "Not authenticated" error
- **Solution**: Make sure you're logged in as a citizen via the web interface first

### Issue: Vote buttons not appearing
- **Solution**: Check that procurements have status='voting' and voting_ends_at > now()

### Issue: Server won't start
- **Solution**: Try `php artisan serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8080`

## 📁 Key Files Modified/Created

1. **VotingTestSeeder.php** - Creates test data
2. **CitizenDashboardController.php** - Handles voting logic
3. **routes/api.php** - Fixed route conflicts
4. **citizen.blade.php** - Frontend voting interface
5. **app.blade.php** - JavaScript helpers (fetchWithCSRF)

## 🏁 Success Criteria

The voting functionality is working correctly if:
- ✅ Citizens can see active procurements
- ✅ Citizens can vote on shortlisted bids
- ✅ Vote counts are updated correctly
- ✅ Duplicate voting is prevented
- ✅ Voting history is maintained
- ✅ UI reflects voting status properly
